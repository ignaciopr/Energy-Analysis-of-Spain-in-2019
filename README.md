# Energy
This Python project aims to analyse a CSV file containing information on energy demand and energy generation in Spain in 2019. 
The data includes the date and time (datetime), the power demand (power_demand), the power generation from different sources (nuclear, gas, solar, hydro, coal and wind) and the spot price of electricity (spot_price).
